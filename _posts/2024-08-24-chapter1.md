**Introduction**

_**What is Research?**_

We all conduct research in everyday life. This is one of the ways in which humans build **knowledge**. When you try to find the best route for your destination or the best travel mug to keep your coffee hot, you conduct research. Some people use cultural beliefs and others heavily rely on their personal and sensory experiences to understand the world around us and to establish **knowledge**. But, what separates “research” from all these other forms of investigations? 

Many dictionary descriptions would use the word “systematic” in order to separate “research” from all the other investigations. Systematic entails building on established practices through the lens of theory, models, or frameworks. This is why research relies on different sets of philosophical substructures and can be shaped based on these areas. In Patricia Leavy’s book “Research Design”, Leavy points out six different philosophical belief systems that shape the way research was conducted. Those were: [postpositivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositivism), [interpretive or constructivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_science)), [critical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory), [transformative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformative_research), [pragmatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmaticism), and [arts-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art-based_research). For most of this class, we will explore areas under postpositivist, interpretive or constructivist, pragmatic, and some critical/transformative. Each word is tagged with a link which you can read Wikipedia articles on. 

_**Before we begin**_

Research requires diligent work. In the social sciences, such as is the case of language science, we study humans and their relationship to language. To ensure that we, as the researchers, do not abuse our participans, we always need to check in with our assumptions, ensure that we follow protocols that are just and in line with human rights, and that we are treating our participants fairly during this process. There is a long history of abusive behavior in research. One example is **_the Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE)_**. SPE is one of the most infamous and controversial psychological studies ever conducted. It was led by psychologist Philip Zimbardo in 1971 at Stanford University. The experiment sought to explore the psychological effects of perceived power, focusing on the struggle between prisoners and prison guards. The study raised profound ethical questions that continue to resonate in discussions of research ethics today.

_Overview of the Experiment_

The experiment involved 24 college students (who all self-identified as men), randomly assigned to play the roles of either guards or prisoners in a mock prison environment set up in the basement of Stanford University’s psychology building. The experiment was intended to last two weeks but was terminated after just six days due to the extreme and distressing behavior exhibited by the participants.

Guards: The "guards" were given uniforms, sunglasses to prevent eye contact, and batons. They were instructed to maintain order, but no specific guidelines on how to do so were provided. Over time, many guards began to display increasingly authoritarian and abusive behavior, subjecting prisoners to psychological torment.

Prisoners: The "prisoners" were stripped of their personal identities, assigned numbers, and were forced to wear smocks with no undergarments. As the experiment progressed, the prisoners exhibited signs of severe emotional distress, passivity, and helplessness.

There were multiple ethical issues raised: Although participants consented to taking part in the study, they were not fully informed about the nature of the experiment or the potential psychological risks involved. The extent of the stress and emotional trauma experienced by the prisoners was far beyond what they had anticipated. The experiment caused significant psychological harm to the participants, particularly those assigned as prisoners. Reports of severe emotional breakdowns, crying, and acute anxiety among the prisoners highlighted the distressing effects of the simulated prison environment. Although the guards were not allowed to physically abuse the prisoners, the psychological tactics employed (such as solitary confinement and sleep deprivation) led to physical and mental health issues.

_Impact on Research Ethics_

The SPE had a profound impact on the field of psychology and the development of ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects. In response to the ethical breaches in the SPE and similar studies, several key changes were made:
**Institutional Review Boards (IRBs):** The role of IRBs became more prominent, with stricter guidelines for reviewing research proposals to ensure the safety and well-being of participants.
Informed Consent: The standards for obtaining informed consent were strengthened, requiring that participants be fully informed of all potential risks and maintain the right to withdraw at any time.
Risk-Benefit Analysis: Researchers are now required to conduct a thorough risk-benefit analysis, ensuring that the potential benefits of the research outweigh any risks to participants.
Debriefing Procedures: The importance of comprehensive debriefing procedures was emphasized to help participants understand the study's purpose and to mitigate any potential harm.
