**Introduction**

_**What is Research?**_
We all conduct research in everyday life. This is one of the ways in which humans build **knowledge**. When you try to find the best route for your destination or the best travel mug to keep your coffee hot, you conduct research. Some people use cultural beliefs and others heavily rely on their personal and sensory experiences to understand the world around us and to establish **knowledge**. But, what separates “research” from all these other forms of investigations? 

Many dictionary descriptions would use the word “systematic” in order to separate “research” from all the other investigations. Systematic entails building on established practices through the lens of theory, models, or frameworks. This is why research relies on different sets of philosophical substructures and can be shaped based on these areas. In Patricia Leavy’s book “Research Design”, Leavy points out six different philosophical belief systems that shape the way research was conducted. Those were: [postpositivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositivism), [interpretive or constructivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_philosophy_of_education), [critical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory), [transformative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformative_research), [pragmatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmaticism), and [arts-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art-based_research). For most of this class, we will explore areas under postpositivist, interpretive or constructivist, pragmatic, and some critical/transformative. Each word is tagged with a link which you can read Wikipedia articles on.
